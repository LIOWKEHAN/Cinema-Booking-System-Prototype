## Technology Used
- Axure RP
Axure RP allows us to design and demonstrate interactive user interfaces without writing code. We used it to create a high-fidelity prototype of the cinema booking system, including key features such as user navigation, seat selection, and payment processing. We made use of dynamic panel, conditional logic, and global variales to simulate user interactions.


## Objectives

1) To design a user-friendly cinema booking interface that allows users to navigate smoothly
2) To evaluate the usability of the system design through structured usability testing, focusing on effectiveness and user satisfaction


## Challenges & Potential Improvements
