## Technology Used
- Axure RP
Axure RP allows us to design and demonstrate interactive user interfaces without writing code. We used it to create a high-fidelity prototype of the cinema booking system, including key features such as user navigation, seat selection, and payment processing. We made use of dynamic panel, conditional logic, and global variales to simulate user interactions.


## Objectives

1) To design a user-friendly cinema booking interface that allows users to navigate smoothly
2) To evaluate the usability of the system design through structured usability testing, focusing on effectiveness and user satisfaction


## Challenges & Potential Improvements

### 1. Limited Backend Simulation in Axure
**Challenges:**
- Axure RP does not support actual database
- Limited realism, especially in account credentials
- Limits the realism and accuracy of usability testing

**Potential Improvements:**
- Integrate mock data using advanced Axure logic

### 2. Small Usability Testing Sample
**Challenges:**
- Feedback may not represent broader user base
- Potential bias from participants who are already tech-savvy
- Rushed test sessions led to shallow insights

**Potential Improvements:**
- Include users with varying levels of digital literacy
- Screen recording the whole testing sessions to help analyze behavior

## Conclusion
- Prototyping helps visualize ideas and user navigation effectively
- Usability testing reveals issues we do not notice ourselves
